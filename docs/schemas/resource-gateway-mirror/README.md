# Resource Gateway Mirror Protocol Schemas

This directory is the wire-contract authority for the Resource Gateway capability-mirror protocol.
Every schema is strict (`additionalProperties: false`), versioned independently, and paired with a
Java protocol model and field-closure test in `resource-gateway-examples`.

| Schema | Java model | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `artifact-provenance-v1.schema.json` | `ArtifactProvenance` | Trust level, source lineage, confidence, approval, expiry, and revocation |
| `effect-contract-v1.schema.json` | `EffectContract` | Conservative transitive read/write/effect and risk summary |
| `capability-contract-v1.schema.json` | `CapabilityContract` | Input/output/error/effect/idempotency/security/SLO contract |
| `capability-snapshot-v1.schema.json` | `CapabilitySnapshot` | Immutable Resource/Operator/Graph projection consumed by mirror planning |
| `capability-closure-v1.schema.json` | `CapabilityClosure` | Exact root plus every transitively reachable snapshot for registry-free planning |
| `capability-lifecycle-transition-v1.schema.json` | `CapabilityLifecycleTransitionRequest` | Optimistically fenced governance transition for one exact revision |

## Invariants

- Every executable reference carries a positive revision and canonical `sha256:<hex>` fingerprint.
- Capability ids are resolved only inside their sealed tenant/organization/project/environment scope;
  scope tenant and provenance tenant must be identical.
- `UNKNOWN` effects remain critical, require an unresolved reason, and cannot collapse to read-only.
- Recorded and inferred provenance requires exact source references.
- Statistical confidence is not legal for owner-declared artifacts.
- An external capability cannot have child capability dependencies.
- A composed capability must freeze at least one exact dependency.
- A snapshot fingerprint covers the complete normalized object with only its own fingerprint field blanked.
- A closure contains one composed root, one exact copy of every reachable dependency, a single enterprise
  scope, no cycles, no unreachable snapshots, and no conflicting fingerprints for one capability revision.
  The Java protocol and JSON Schema both cap the root-plus-dependency set at 10001 snapshots; iterative graph
  validation prevents deep dependency chains from consuming the JVM call stack. Its fingerprint covers the
  complete normalized closure.
- Revision one must be `DRAFT`; later revisions are contiguous, append-only, and accepted only through the
  lifecycle transition matrix. `REVOKED` is terminal.

## Projection implementation

`CapabilityProjectionService` is the current Java projection boundary:

- Resource descriptors become sealed external capability snapshots.
- Only external/resource-backed/runtime-bound operators become standalone capabilities; pure internal
  operators remain covered by their parent graph fingerprint.
- Generic `httpResource` nodes with a constant `resourceId` binding close over that exact Resource
  capability. A context/expression-driven `resourceId` remains a generic Operator capability with an
  `UNKNOWN` effect and blocked runtime readiness until a bounded dispatch contract is supplied.
- Graph drafts close over exact sealed external or nested capability snapshots and conservatively inherit
  effects, errors, determinism, security, state-model references, route conditions, and runtime limitations.
- `BuiltInCapabilityClosureService` derives all seven shipped graph closures from the classpath DSL, formal
  graph contracts, current operator catalog, and resource registry. Nested `foreach`/`loop` capability sites
  receive stable structural paths and conditions, while a raw DSL digest protects syntax that is not yet flat
  in the visual draft. No second hand-maintained graph inventory is used.
- The AI streaming graph honestly remains runtime-blocked by current visual runtime readiness. Dynamic
  resource dispatch remains effect-unknown and runtime-blocked; the other five static resource graphs are ready.
- Unknown effects, unresolved child identity, unsealed children, conflicting errors, and ambiguous state
  models fail closed with stable `RG.MIRROR.*` error codes.

## Repository and integration boundary

`DatabaseCapabilitySnapshotRepository` stores sealed snapshots under a compound
tenant/organization/project/environment/region/capability/revision identity. It rejects gaps, mutation,
corrupt rows, illegal lifecycle transitions, and non-identical retries. Exact identical retries are idempotent.

The protected Tool Studio integration surface exposes:

| Method and path | Purpose | Required `X-Purpose` |
|---|---|---|
| `PUT /api/integration/capability-snapshots/{id}/revisions/{revision}` | Append an exact sealed revision | `CAPABILITY_PROJECTION` or `CHANGE_SYNC` |
| `GET /api/integration/capability-snapshots/{id}?revision=0` | Read latest, or set a positive exact revision | `MIRROR_REHEARSAL`, `CHANGE_SYNC`, or `GOVERNANCE_EVIDENCE_INGESTION` |
| `POST /api/integration/capability-snapshots/{id}/lifecycle-transitions` | Append a lifecycle-only revision | `CAPABILITY_GOVERNANCE` |

All three endpoints derive scope, actor, and clearance from the verified workload identity. Absent,
cross-scope, and above-clearance reads deliberately share `404 RG.MIRROR.SNAPSHOT_NOT_FOUND` so the API does
not become an asset-existence oracle.

The closure/projection/schema/nested-DSL/real-Spring increment has 25 green focused tests. The broader selected
protocol/repository/API/probe suite has 66 green tests. The full `clean verify` baseline is 4349 tests, 0 failures,
0 errors, and 2 skipped; the executable Spring Boot JAR was also repackaged successfully. This verifies the seven
shipped resource graphs, not the three frontend-only visual examples or the complete Stage 0 exit gate.

The Stage 0 schema presence does not make mirror execution available. Capability discovery must keep
runtime feature flags disabled until built-in asset closure, API authorization, plan compilation,
external-leaf interception, isolation, and evidence paths have all passed their own release gates.
